      These are a collections of some of my personal favorite projects that I have created/contributed to in my free time. I also have a lot more projects available open-sourced on my <a href="https://github.com/torch2424" target="_blank">Github</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/julianpoy/Flyxer" target="_blank">Flyxer</a> is a live performance music software that allows for loop switching "on the fly" with an easy to use interface. Along with a large collection of effects to edit your sound
        as it is playing.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Flyxer was developed at
        <a href="http://devpost.com/software/hacktech2016" target="_blank">Hacktech 2016</a> in 36 hours, and won the award, "Coolest Developer Tool". In my team of three,
        <a href="https://github.com/julianpoy" target="_blank">Julian Poyourow</a>, Alexis Luter, and myself, I created the user interface, and user experience of the application, as well as handled the effects being applied to the JavaScript audio objects.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Flyxer was built using
        <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>,
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>, and
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. As well as the third-party JavaScript libraries,
        <a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad">WAD</a> (Which I have contributed to!), and
        <a href="https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna">Tuna</a>.

        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.torch2424.featherads" target="_blank">Stats Monitor Widget</a> is a minimal, conky-like, system monitor that sits on an android device's home screen, and displays per-core CPU usage, memory
        usage, network information, and other statistics of the userâ€™s device.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Stats Monitor features various android libraries, such as, Broadcast Receviers for listening to system wide events, Shared Preferences for saving user configurations, and App Widget Providers which allows connecting Remote Views to the widget,
        and making it available to be created by an Android launcher.

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/torch2424/Punch-Legacy" target="_blank">Super Punch Legacy</a> is a top-down cross-platform retro style arcade game, where a hero must punch to defeat waves of exploding enemies and deadly bosses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I developed sound and logic for the game, where visual art was created by members of
        <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/" target="_blank">Team No Comply Games</a>. I handled all development of the game in
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> and implemented features such as, Camera Shake, Player Leveling, Player Save Management, Enemy Patterns, Character/Map Selection, and Game Physics.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Beta builds are coming very soon!

      <h2>linkDrops</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="http://linkdrops.com/#/" target="_blank">linkDrops</a> is a website that will store all of those links you wanted to go back to, but never could, in an easy to use interface. linkDrops is perfect for things like youtube videos, articles,
        and repos!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> linkDrops' frontend is developed using JavaScript and CSS, and handls things such as keeping the link grid in order, sending requests to the backend to create accounts, save and manage user's links, and send requests to APIs provided by
        <a href="https://noembed.com/" target="_blank">Noembed</a>,
        <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>,
        <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and various other services to create iframes, and embeds of a user's link once they hover over the link. I had a bit of help from
        <a href="https://github.com/julianpoy" target="_blank">Julian Poyourow</a>, as he mostly developed the back end, but we help one another in both the front and back end.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> linkDrops was built in the "MEAN" stack. Meaning it was built using powerful, modern day web development which includes:
        <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>,
        <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>,
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>. It was styled using
        <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, a powerful css framework. Also, some other css libraries such as
        <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">Animate.css</a> and
        <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/" target="_blank">Angular Material</a>. linkDrops also implements some third-party libraries such as
        <a href="https://github.com/hongkhanh/gridify" target="_blank">Gridify</a>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/thenikso/angular-inview" target="_blank">Angular-inview</a>.

      <h2>This Website!</h2>
      <img class="webScreen" src="images/personal.png" alt="Website Screenshot">
      <p>
        This website was built entirely in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. Which allows for amazing load times efficient development, and powerful JavaScript implementation! And it was styled using
        <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, a robust css framework. Also, some other css libraries such as
        <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">Animate.css</a> and
        <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">Materialize.css</a>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I developed my entire personal website myself (no spooky ghost coders around here!), which includes deployment onto my own
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, droplet running
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a>, to host this website.
