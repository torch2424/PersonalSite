  <p>
    I have created/contributed to these websites and web apps as personal projects, or contracted work.
    I primarily use
    <a href = "https://angularjs.org/" target ="_blank">AngularJS</a>
    and
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target ="_blank">Sass</a>
    for my frontend web development.
    The projects I can share publicly, could be found on my <a href="https://github.com/torch2424" target ="_blank">Github</a>.

        <p>
            <a href = "http://linkdrops.com/#/" target ="_blank">linkDrops</a> is a website that will store all of
            those links you wanted to go back to, but never could,
            in an easy to use interface. linkDrops is perfect for
            things like youtube videos, articles, and repos!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            In linkDrops, I formulated the original app idea. I also developed the UI and UX of the application.
            I mostly developed the frontend using Javascript and CSS, And handled things such as keeping the link
            grid in order, sending requests to the backend to create accounts, save and manage user's links, and
            send requests to apis provided by
            <a href = "https://noembed.com/" target ="_blank">Noembed</a>,
            <a href = "https://developers.soundcloud.com/" target ="_blank">Soundcloud</a>,
            <a href = "https://developer.spotify.com/" target ="_blank">Spotify</a>,

            and various other services to create iframes, and embeds of a user's link once they hover over the link.
            I had a bit of help from
            <a href = "https://github.com/julianpoy" target ="_blank">Julian Poyourow</a>,
            as he mostly developed the backend, but we help one another in both the front and back end.

          linkDrops was built in the "MEAN" stack.
          Meaning is was built using powerful, modern day
          web development which includes:
          <a href = "https://www.mongodb.org/" target ="_blank">MongoDB</a>,
          <a href = "http://expressjs.com/" target ="_blank">Express</a>,
          <a href = "https://angularjs.org/" target ="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
          and <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/" target ="_blank">NodeJS</a>.


          It was styled using
          <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target ="_blank">Sass</a>, a powerful css framework. Also, some other css libraries such as
          <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target ="_blank">Animate.css</a> and
          <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/" target ="_blank">Angular Material</a>.

          linkDrops also implements some third-party libraries such as
          <a href="https://github.com/hongkhanh/gridify" target ="_blank">Gridify</a>, and
          <a href="https://github.com/thenikso/angular-inview" target ="_blank">Angular-inview</a>.

      <h2>This Website!<h2>
        <img class = "webScreen" src="images/personal.png" alt="Website Screenshot">
        <p>
          This website was built entirely in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target ="_blank">AngularJS</a>. Which allows for amazing load times
          efficient development, and powerful javascript implementation! And it was styled using
          <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target ="_blank">Sass</a>, a robust css framework. Also, some other css libraries such as
          <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target ="_blank">Animate.css</a> and
          <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target ="_blank">Materialize.css</a>

          <br>

          I developed my entire personal website myself (no spooky ghost coders around here!),
          which includes deployment onto my own
          <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target ="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>,
          droplet running
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target ="_blank">Apache</a>,
          to host this website. Also, I maintain the controller logic
          for things like the navigation bar of the website,
          and style and design the user interface.

            is a social network that revolves around
            your own events, gatherings and parties. And those
            that are happening around you!
            Made with
            <a href = "http://kondeo.com/#/" target ="_blank">Kondeo Development</a>
            (Still in pre-alpha phases)

            Nude was conceptualized by
            <a href = "https://github.com/julianpoy" target ="_blank">Julian Poyourow</a>,
            and he built out most of both the front and back end of the application. However, I
            contributed to work in the front end, and did some styling, created an events route to
            display individual event details. As well as solved some navigation bugs where the incorrect
            text would display after a user logged in. Nudge was actually one of the first
            <a href = "https://angularjs.org/" target ="_blank">AngularJS</a>
            projects I contributed to, and helped me fall in love with the framework.

            <br>
          "Nudge"
          was built with
          <a href = "https://angularjs.org/" target ="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
          and PHP. Which gives a very fast and clean
          user experience on the frontend,
          with a powerful and reliable backend.


          And it was styled using
          <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target ="_blank">Sass</a>,
          a solid css framework.

          is a simple text calculator that works with a press of a key,
          and gives your answer INSTANTLY. Built with both developers and users in mind,
          It strives to be a calculator that will save time editing, solving, and calculating any number crunching.
          Simply enter a statement and have you answer shown to you real time as it is entered.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


          Crunchkey was the first web development project I created. And was actually one of the most useful.
          I used this application to learn basic web development, and developed it entirely myself. I created the
          calculation logic (by parsing the input expression into a stack) and design of the app.

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Crunchkey was developed using Html, Javascript, and
          <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target ="_blank">Babel</a>
