      This website was built entirely in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. Which allows for amazing load times
      efficient development, and powerful javascript implementation! And it was styled using
      <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, a powerful css extension. Also, some other css libraries such as
      <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> and
      <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize.css</a>

      is a simple text calculator that works with a press of a key,
      and gives your answer INSTANTLY. Built with both developers and users in mind,
      It strives to be a calculator that will save time editing, solving, and calculating any number crunching.
      Simply enter a statement and have you answer shown to you real time as it is entered.
