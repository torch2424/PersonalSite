            <b>Skateboarding</b> has been there for me since I was young.
            And I love skater culture, and anything that can help the skate community.
            I also enjoy filming and creating <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OktGiy8GWg" target ="_blank">skate videos</a>
            with some buddies from my hometown.
        </li>

        <li>
            I got my first super nintendo in 1997 (I was two years old!)
            and I've had a <b>video game</b> controller in my hands ever since.
            I am a big fan of games such as <b>Kingdom Hearts</b>, <b>Pokemon</b>,
            <b>Super Smash Brothers</b>, <b>Halo</b>, and <b>all kinds of indie games</b>.
            I've wanted to make video games since I was 5, which is why I started my
            own indie game development studio,
            <a href = "http://nocomplygames.com/" target ="_blank">Tem No Comply Games</a>,
            with some of my buddies. I make games with them in my free time.
        </li>

        <li>
            I <b>code</b> almost every single day. And I am quite grateful for it.
            I love code (obviously!), and it is awesome that I get to code for work!
            I love going to
            <a href = "https://mlh.io/" target ="_blank">Hackathons</a>
            and I try to go to as many as I can, because who can say "no" to crazy
            awesome projects and free food?
            I am also a fan of the open-source communitty,
            which is why I leave most of my
            <a href = "https://github.com/torch2424" target ="_blank">projects on github</a>
            as open-source under the
            <a href = "http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/" target ="_blank">Apache License 2.0</a>.
