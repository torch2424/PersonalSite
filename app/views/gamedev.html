    <p>
      I have created these games as personal projects for fun under my independent game studio,
      <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/" target="_blank">Team No Comply Games</a>! I often document the process of creating these games, and offer new content on
      <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/" target="_blank">Team No Comply Games</a>' website. I primarily use
      <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> for all of my game development. Most of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/torch2424" target="_blank">Github</a>.

        <a href="https://github.com/torch2424/Punch-Legacy" target="_blank">Super Punch Legacy</a> is a top-down cross-platform retro style arcade game, where a hero must punch to defeat waves of exploding enemies and deadly bosses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I developed sound and logic for the game, where visual art was created by members of
        <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/" target="_blank">Team No Comply Games</a>. I handled all development of the game in
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> and implemented features such as, Camera Shake, Player Leveling, Player Save Management, Enemy Patterns, Character/Map Selection, and Game Physics.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Beta builds are coming very soon!

        <a href="https://github.com/torch2424/Punch-Legacy" target="_blank">Bushy Tailed Terror</a> is a cross-platform 2-d action platformer, about a squirell with a bazooka that must destroy the deadly bugs in a nearby dungeon.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Bushy Tailed Terror was made in 24 hours at
        <a href="http://devpost.com/software/bushy-tailed-terror" target="_blank">HackPoly 2016</a>, And also has a short
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vOuInaCowc" target="_blank">gameplay video</a>, and a playable
        <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/?game=bushy-tailed-terror" target="_blank">HTML5 Demo</a>. Please notice that the game has plenty of bugs as it was developed so quickly, and may not run well on macs or slower computers.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I developed sound and logic for the game, where visual art, player physics, and maps were created by members of
        <a href="http://nocomplygames.com/" target="_blank">Team No Comply Games</a>, who were also at the hackathon. Most of the development of the game was handled by myself using
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>, and implemented features such as, bullet physics, damage calculation, jump counters, collision detection, and enemy logic.

      <p>

        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.torch2424.trustinheartdemo" target="_blank">Trust in Heart</a> is an indie RPG / JRPG Trust In Heart! This game is an fun and epic adventure of a weak hero that must overcome the king
        of monsters, to save his love and bring back the peace to the world! There is currently a demo of the game available on the
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.torch2424.trustinheartdemo" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, and a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDeAQ_5g7kY" target="_blank">gameplay trailer</a>.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> This game was developed for Android, which brought many struggles that I learned a lot from! It helped me to learn Android Handlers, XML Layouts, Services, Lifecycles and States, Saving Serializeable Java Objects, as well as the Libraries
        that make up the Android SDK! Though, As I figured it would be much easier to make the game in an actual game engine, so the game was put on hold to do so.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Trust in Heart was developed using the
        <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">Android Studio IDE</a>. But, currently I am switching development to
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.
