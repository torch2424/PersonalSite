    Localight is a mobile giftcard and loyalty program for small businesses. It used user's phones to request giftcards through text message, which would then bring them to a mobile web-app to send and receive giftcards from their friends. Localight was developed
    by Localism in downtown Long Beach, CA. However, the app was taken down as Localism went through some restructuring after I had left.

  <p>At Localism, I worked on a two-person team to create a web-app that provided a local ecommerce/gift-card platform on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">MEAN stack</a>. I was responsible for the
    applicationâ€™s styling, controller logic, user validation, deployment, and debit card charge requests.
