    During an internship at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, I worked on the Alexa Developer Experience team, which handled the infrastructure for third party developers to create skills for Alexa.

  <p>As a team-member of Alexa Developer Experience, I worked on the developer website and api for developing and submitting skills for Alexa. My work consisted of creating: Alexa skills, session keep-alive services on the client, interactive client-side
    components to help with defining skill utterances, introducing new open-source tools to the teamâ€™s build system, and exposing audio streaming APIs in the Alexa Skills Kit. Documentation for the audio streaming APIs that I contributed to can be found
