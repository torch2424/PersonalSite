    This website was built entirely in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. Which allows for amazing load times efficient development, and powerful JavaScript implementation! And it was styled using
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, a robust css framework. Also, some other css libraries such as
    <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">Animate.css</a> and
    <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">Materialize.css</a>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br> I developed my entire personal website myself (no spooky ghost coders around here!), which includes deployment onto my own
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, droplet running
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a>, to host this website.
